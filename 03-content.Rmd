# Writing Tutorial Content {#content}

Now that you have your environment set up, let's learn how to create compelling tutorial content using R Markdown. This chapter covers the essential techniques for writing effective GitBook tutorials.

## Project Structure with .Rmd Files

Each `.Rmd` file in your project becomes a chapter in your GitBook. The structure is simple:

```
my-tutorial/
|-- index.Rmd          # Main page (Chapter 0)
|-- 01-chapter1.Rmd    # Chapter 1
|-- 02-chapter2.Rmd    # Chapter 2
|-- 03-chapter3.Rmd    # Chapter 3
`-- ...
```

### File Naming Convention

- **index.Rmd**: Always the main/first page
- **01-intro.Rmd**: Use numbers for ordering
- **XY-descriptive-names.Rmd**: Use descriptive names after numbers

## Headings Create Sections

Headings automatically create your table of contents and navigation structure:

```markdown
# Chapter Title {#chapter-id}

## Main Section

### Subsection  

#### Sub-subsection
```

### Important Notes:
- `# Chapter Title` creates a new chapter
- `{#chapter-id}` creates an ID for cross-referencing
- Only use `#` for chapter titles in chapter files
- Use `##`, `###`, `####` for sections within chapters

## Code Chunks: The Heart of R Tutorials

Code chunks are what make R Markdown special. They execute R code and display the results:

### Basic Code Chunk

````
```{r}`r ''`
# This is R code
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(x)
```
````


```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(x)
```


### Code Chunk Options

Control how your code appears and executes:



````
```{r your-chunk-name, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Simple Line Plot"}`r ''`
# echo=TRUE: Show the code
# eval=TRUE: Run the code  
# fig.cap: Caption for figures
plot(1:10, 1:10)
```
````


Here's the actual chunk in action:

```{r chunk-name, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Simple Line Plot"}
# A simple demonstration plot
plot(1:10, 1:10, type="b", 
     main="Simple Line Plot", 
     xlab="X values", 
     ylab="Y values")
```

**Common options:**

- `echo=FALSE`: Hide code, show output
- `eval=FALSE`: Show code, don't run it
- `include=FALSE`: Run code, don't show anything
- `message=FALSE`: Hide messages
- `warning=FALSE`: Hide warnings

## Creating Plots and Visualizations

R excels at creating beautiful plots:

```{r plot-example, fig.cap="Sample Scatter Plot", fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl))) +
  labs(title = "Horsepower vs MPG",
       x = "Miles per Gallon",
       y = "Horsepower",
       color = "Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Inline R Code

You can embed R results directly in your text using inline code:

The mean of `mtcars$mpg` is `r knitr::inline_expr("round(mean(mtcars$mpg), 2)")` miles per gallon.


The mean of mtcars$mpg is `r round(mean(mtcars$mpg), 2)` miles per gallon.

## Mathematical Notation

LaTeX syntax works beautifully in GitBooks:

### Inline Math
```markdown
The formula is $y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope.
```
**Result:** The formula is $y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope.

### Block Math
```markdown
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$
```

**Result:**
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$

## Cross-References and Links

### Referencing Figures and Tables

```markdown
See Figure \@ref(fig:plot-example) for the scatter plot.
```

**Result:** See Figure \@ref(fig:plot-example) for the scatter plot.

### Referencing Sections

```markdown
As we learned in Chapter \@ref(intro), GitBook format is powerful.
```

**Result:** As we learned in Chapter \@ref(intro), GitBook format is powerful.

### Creating Tables

```{r cars-table}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:4]), 
  caption = "First few rows of mtcars dataset",
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

Reference it with: `Table \@ref(tab:cars-table)`

## Optional Enhancements

### Footnotes

Add footnotes for additional information. First, reference the footnote, then define what the footnote reads.
Footnotes will be placed at the bottom of the page automatically.

```markdown
This is the text where the footnote is referenced[^note1].
[^note1]: This is the content of the footnote.
```


Result:

This is the text where the footnote is referenced[^note1].

(Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the footnote.)

[^note1]: And this is the content of the footnote.

### Citations with BibTeX

First, create a `references.bib` file:

```bibtex
@book{wickham2016r,
  title={R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data},
  author={Wickham, Hadley and Grolemund, Garrett},
  year={2016},
  publisher={O'Reilly Media}
}
```

Then cite it:

```markdown
According to @wickham2016r, data science is a powerful approach.
```

### Adding Images


```markdown
![Caption for image](path/to/image.png)
```


Or with more control:


````
```{r, fig.cap="My Image", out.width="50%", eval=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image.png")
```
````


### Callouts and Special Blocks

Create attention-grabbing callouts:

```markdown
> **Note:** This is an important note that readers should pay attention to.

> **Warning:** Be careful with this command as it might delete files.

> **Tip:** Here's a helpful tip to make your work easier.
```

**Results:**

> **Note:** This is an important note that readers should pay attention to.

> **Warning:** Be careful with this command as it might delete files.

> **Tip:** Here's a helpful tip to make your work easier.
